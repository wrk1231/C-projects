Part 1. This CSV file (zipped) has data for 1000 assets over 250 days. Write a Python script that compute the average asset returns and the covariance of returns for the first K assets over the first N days. Here K and N are part of the command line. Output the results to a file.

Part 2. Implement the first-order algorithm we discussed in class. Test it on this example. Test it on larger examples obtained as in Part 1 (formatted as in the small example). You may assume that the maximum weight for any asset is max(0.01, 2/n), and the minimum weight is zero.
